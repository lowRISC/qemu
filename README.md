# QEMU OpenTitan README

QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and
virtualizer.

QEMU is capable of emulating a complete machine in software without any
need for hardware virtualization support. By using dynamic translation,
it achieves very good performance.

This repository is a fork of QEMU dedicated to support Ibex and OpenTitan
platforms.
