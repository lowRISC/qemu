# QEMU OpenTitan README

QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and virtualizer.

QEMU is capable of emulating a complete machine in software without any need for hardware
virtualization support. By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance.

This branch contains a fork of QEMU 8.0.2 dedicated to support lowRISC Ibex platforms:
  * OpenTitan Darjeeling with FPGA "Bergen Board" CW310 memory map.

See [ot_ref.log](hw/opentitan/ot_ref.log) for OpenTitan reference.
